This webserver is the product of the work between Jacob Hill and myself for our Java programming class. 
The requirement was to develop a website which addressed a social challenge. 
This social challenge was the government's progress towards closing the gap.
We chose to address this social challenge by presenting data at three different levels of details, to suit the needs of a broader range of users.
This assignment also included creating studies of usability testing, and development of personas.

For this assignment, Jacob and I received a mark of 88/100.
